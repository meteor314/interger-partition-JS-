# Integer-partition JS
In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. (If order matters, the sum becomes a composition.) For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:

    4
    3 + 1
    2 + 2
    2 + 1 + 1
    1 + 1 + 1 + 1

This program is made from the JS and could be optimized.

For ease of calculation, we do not recommend to use a number greater than 20 (because the number of partitions increases exponentially)!  

You can create a copy of this program, in local ! 

    $ git clone https://github.com/meteor314/Integer-partition-JavaScript
    $ cd Integer-partition-JavaScript


Enjoy guys !
